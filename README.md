This project is a simple Java implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project has been assigned as the final group project to the SSK3101 _ Java Programming 2 in the semester 1 2022/2023 at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM).

*Although this implementation aims to provide a sample solution to my students, it should not be considered as a reference for standard coding as it is in no way optimized and does not follow the clean coding practices.* However, it has been tried to follow the basic principles of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and practice what we have discussed in our lab sessions in the implementation of this project.

This passion project has been done in my free time, and it serves the purpose of providing a sample code for the final project of the SSK3101 course. Furthermore, it is hoped that this implementation can introduce fundamentals of AI to my students and show them what can be achieved with a bit of programming and AI.

The main features of this project include:
  * Player vs. Player game;
  * Player vs. Random Bot game;
  * Player vs. learning AI Bot game;
  * Training AI Bot against Random Bot;
  * Tarining AI Bot against itself;
  * Saving the Custom trained AI Bot in an external file;
  * And loading a trained AI Bot with different difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard, Custom) from external files.

This prjoect is fully open-source. Anybody is free to use, study, modify, and distribute this project for any purpose. HOWEVER, MY STUDENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY ANY PART OF THIS CODE IN THEIR PROJECT. For more information, feel free to read the license file.
